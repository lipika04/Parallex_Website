            <p>
                Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.
                <br><br>
                Nature is also a subject of scientific study, as well as a source of inspiration for many artists, writers, and philosophers. Some people believe that nature is sacred and should be protected from human interference, while others see nature as a resource to be used for human benefit

                <h2>FOREST</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                A forest is an area of land dominated by trees. Hundreds of definitions of forest are used throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal standing, and ecological function. 
                <br><br>
                A **forest** is a complex ecological system in which trees are the dominant life-form  . Forests can occur wherever the temperatures rise above 10 °C (50 °F) in the warmest months and the annual precipitation is more than 200 mm (8 inches) . They can develop under a variety of conditions within these climatic limits, and the kind of soil, plant, and animal life differs according to the extremes of environmental influences . There are different types of forests such as boreal forest, deciduous forest, and tropical rainforest .

                <h2>MOUNTAINS</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                Heights of mountains are typically measured above sea level. Using this metric, Mount Everest is the highest mountain on Earth, at 8,848 metres (29,029 ft). There are at least 100 mountains with heights of over 7,200 metres (23,622 ft) above sea level, all of which are located in central and southern Asia.
                <br><br>
                Climate in the mountains becomes colder at high elevations, due to an interaction between radiation and convection.The colder climate on mountains affects the plants and animals residing on mountains.

                <h2>SEA</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                A sea is a large body of salty water. There are particular seas and the sea. The sea commonly refers to the ocean, the wider body of seawater. Particular seas are either marginal seas, second-order sections of the oceanic sea (e.g. the Mediterranean Sea), or certain large, nearly landlocked bodies of water.
                <br><br>
                The terms "the ocean" or "the sea" used without specification refer to the interconnected body of salt water covering the majority of the Earth's surface. It includes the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Antarctic/Southern and Arctic Oceans. As a general term, "the ocean" and "the sea" are often interchangeable, although speakers of British English refer to "the sea" in all cases, even when the body of water is one of the oceans.
